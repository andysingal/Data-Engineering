Pros and Cons of a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses act as a centralized repository for organizations to store all their data coming in from a multitude of sources, allowing data consumers such as analysts and BI engineers to access data easily and quickly from one single source to start their analysis. In addition, the technological components powering data warehouses enable accessing vast volumes of data while supporting workloads such as business intelligence to run on top of it.

Data warehouses act as a centralized repository for organizations to store data from multiple sources, enabling easy access for analysis by data consumers.
Data warehouses are limited to relational workloads and cannot handle machine learning-based tasks natively, requiring data to be moved to other platforms for advanced analytics.
Data warehouses support only structured data, limiting the ability to analyze semi-structured and unstructured data, which can provide valuable insights.
Data warehouses have tightly coupled technical components, leading to a closed form of data architecture and potential data lock-in issues.
Storing data in a data warehouse and using its compute engines can result in significant costs, especially with increasing workloads over time.
Organizations are seeking alternative data platforms like Data Lakes, allowing data to be stored in open file formats, reducing costs, and enabling parallel processing for BI and machine learning.

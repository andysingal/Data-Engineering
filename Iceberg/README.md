Pros and Cons of a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses act as a centralized repository for organizations to store all their data coming in from a multitude of sources, allowing data consumers such as analysts and BI engineers to access data easily and quickly from one single source to start their analysis. In addition, the technological components powering data warehouses enable accessing vast volumes of data while supporting workloads such as business intelligence to run on top of it.

Data warehouses act as a centralized repository for organizations to store data from multiple sources, enabling easy access for analysis by data consumers.
Data warehouses are limited to relational workloads and cannot handle machine learning-based tasks natively, requiring data to be moved to other platforms for advanced analytics.
Data warehouses support only structured data, limiting the ability to analyze semi-structured and unstructured data, which can provide valuable insights.
Data warehouses have tightly coupled technical components, leading to a closed form of data architecture and potential data lock-in issues.
Storing data in a data warehouse and using its compute engines can result in significant costs, especially with increasing workloads over time.
Organizations are seeking alternative data platforms like Data Lakes, allowing data to be stored in open file formats, reducing costs, and enabling parallel processing for BI and machine learning.

Note that in data lakes, there isn’t really any service that fulfills the needs of the storage engine function. Generally the compute engine decides how to write the data, then the data is usually never revisited and optimized, unless rewriting entire tables or partitions which is usually done on an ad-hoc basis


Pros of a Data Lake:

Lower Cost: Storing data and executing queries on a data lake is more cost-effective compared to a data warehouse, allowing wider analytical reach.
Store Data in Open Formats: Data can be stored in any file format, providing more control over data and compatibility with various tools.
Handle Unstructured Data: Data lakes support unstructured data, making them suitable for analytics on such data types.
Cons of a Data Lake:

Performance: Decoupled components in a data lake may lead to performance issues, requiring significant engineering efforts to optimize.
Lack of ACID Guarantees: Data lakes may not offer ACID guarantees, affecting data consistency and integrity.
Lots of Configuration: Setting up and configuring a data lake with optimal performance and coupling requires significant input from data engineers, potentially adding to costs.


Enter Data Lakehouse
While using a data warehouse gave us performance and ease of use, analytics on data lakes gave us lower costs and reduced data drift from a complex web of data copies. The desire to thread the needle leads to great strides and innovation leading to what we now know as the data lakehouse.

What makes a data lakehouse truly unique are data lake table formats that eliminate all the previous issues with the Hive table format. You store the data in the same places you would with a data lake, you use the query engines you would use with a data lake, your data is stored in the same formats it would be on a data lake, what truly transforms your world from a “read only” data to a “center of my data world” data lakehouse is the table format (refer to Figure 1-4). Table formats enabled better consistency, performance and ACID guarantees when working with data directly on your data lake storage leading to several value propositions.

- Fewer Copies, Less Drift
With ACID guarantees and better performance you can now move workloads typically saved for the data warehouse like updates and other data manipulation. If you don’t have to move your data to the lakehouse you can have a more streamlined architecture with fewer copies. Fewer copies mean less storage costs, less compute costs from moving data to a data warehouse, and better governance of your data to maintain compliance with regulations and internal controls.

- Faster Queries, Fast Insights
The end goal is always to get business value from quality insights from our data, everything is else just steps to that end. If you can get faster queries that means you can get insights faster. Data Lakehouses enable faster performing queries by using optimizations at the query engine, table format and file format.

- Mistakes Don’t Have to Hurt
Data Lakehouse table formats enable the possibility to undo mistakes by using snapshot isolation, allowing you to revert the table back to prior snapshots. You can work with your data but not have to be up at night wondering if a mistake will lead to hours of auditing, repairing then backfilling.
